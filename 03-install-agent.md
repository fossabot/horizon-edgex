# Install the Open Horizon Agent

This continues the instructions from [Install the Open Horizon Services](01-horizon-services-setup.md) and 
[Build and Run](02-build-and-run-horizon.md) the Open Horizon Services.

Stand up your environment in the other tier for the Horizon Agent (Anax) and open a shell.  
Do not attempt this in the same environment as the Horizon Services 
due to port conflicts and environment variable collisions.
Instructions below are for either Ubuntu or OSX.

## For OSX

Install brew package manager

``` bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

brew update
brew upgrade
brew install wget
```

[Get and install](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) Docker

``` bash
wget https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg
```

Test after install

``` bash
docker --version
```

Download and install the Edge Fabric client

``` bash
wget http://pkg.bluehorizon.network/macos/horizon-cli-2.23.13.pkg
```

Install first (you may use the GUI and double-click on the file to install), 
then start the client using the command below:

``` bash
horizon-container start
```

Test after install

``` bash
hzn version

hzn node list
```

When you look at the output for `hzn node list`, pay attention to the line for the exchange api:

``` json
"exchange_api": "https://alpha.edge-fabric.com/v1/"
```

When the Anax agent is properly configured, 
it will point to the public IP address of the Horizon Services that you stood up earlier instead of `alpha.edge-fabric.com`, 
and is useful for confirming proper configuration.

To fix, stop the container, create a file at `/etc/default/horizon` with the contents below, then restart the container and test.

``` bash
horizon-container stop
sudo mkdir -p /etc/default
sudo touch /etc/default/horizon
```

Then edit the `/etc/default/horizon` file and insert the following contents. 
*NOTE*: Replace `127.0.0.1` with your Horizon Services public IP address.

```
HZN_EXCHANGE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/
HZN_FSS_CSSURL=https://alpha.edge-fabric.com/css/
```

Then re-start the container:

``` bash
horizon-container start
```

And then check the output to confirm that the exchange api value is now set to your exchange service public IP address:

``` bash
hzn node list
```

-----

## For Ubuntu

IMPORTANT, DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP

Become root so the following several steps will work properly

``` bash
sudo -s
```

Update the package manager

``` bash
apt-get -y update
```

Install and test Docker

``` bash
curl -fsSL get.docker.com | sh
docker --version
```

Configure package manager for the Anax Agent:

If you operating system is not xenial (16.x) then update the following appropriately for bionic (18.x).
*NOTE*: If you did not copy the CRLF after `EOF`, then you will need to press Enter/Return on your keyboard.

``` bash
wget -qO - http://pkg.bluehorizon.network/bluehorizon.network-public.key | apt-key add -
aptrepo=testing
cat <<EOF > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bluehorizon.list
deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture)] http://pkg.bluehorizon.network/linux/ubuntu xenial-$aptrepo main
deb-src [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture)] http://pkg.bluehorizon.network/linux/ubuntu xenial-$aptrepo main
EOF

```

Refresh package manager index list

``` bash
apt-get -y update
```

Install and the Agent

``` bash
apt-get -y install bluehorizon
```

IMPORTANT, exit out of root, back to your user account

``` bash
exit
```

Check the version to confirm that the Horizon CLI is installed and working

``` bash
hzn version
```

Check to ensure that it is working and your machine/node is "unconfigured"

``` bash
hzn node list
```
When you look at the output for `hzn node list`, pay attention to the line for the exchange api:

``` json
"exchange_api": ""
```

When the Agent is properly configured, 
it will point to the public IP address of the Horizon Services that you stood up earlier, and is useful for confirming proper configuration.

To fix this, you will edit the horizon agent configuration file and then restart the agent service.

Please note two important details: first, the protocol is `http` instead of `https` (due to lack of a public signed cert), 
and second, the URL *must* end with a trailing slash, even though the corresponding environment variable does not.  

Edit the file at `/etc/default/horizon` using `sudo` to set the exchange URL (HZN_EXCHANGE_URL) to `http://${MY_IP}:3090/v1/`.

Also add the MSS URL and set your device id.

Edit the file at `/etc/default/horizon` using `sudo` to set the MMS URL (HZN_FSS_CSSURL) to `http://${MY_IP}:9443`.
Edit the file at `/etc/default/horizon` using `sudo` to set the device id (HZN_DEVICE_ID) to whatever you want, e.g. mynode.

Restart the Agent service:

``` bash
sudo systemctl restart horizon
```

and confirm that the changes took effect by re-running `hzn node list` and checking the `exchange_api` value.

Also, verify that the "exchange_version" is correct.
If it is an empty string, then the agent does not have network connectivity to the exchange.
You will need to resolve this problem before you continue.
